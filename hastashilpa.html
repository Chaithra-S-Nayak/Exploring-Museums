        <h3> About Museum:</h3>
        <img  src="https://files.yappe.in/place/full/hasta-shilpa-heritage-village-museum-79716.webp" alt="Hasta Shilpa Heritage Village Museum">
        <P>Hasta Shilpa Heritage Village Museum is managed by Hasta Shilpa Trust which is a not-for-profit, public charitable trust started by Vijayanath Shenoy. It is registered with the Government of Karnataka. It stands for restoration, conservation, preservation and promotion of India's fast-vanishing architectural heritage and material culture within the larger framework of the arts and culture. It also supports the development of knowledge and human resources in the arena of the arts, crafts and culture.</P>
        
    </div> 
    <div class="box">
        <h3> Vijayanath Shenoy - Founder (June 3, 1934 – March 9, 2017)</h3>
           <p>Vijayanath Shenoy was born on June 3, 1934 in Udupi, Southern Karnataka. The ambience that surrounded him in his early life deeply influenced and shaped the young man: on one hand was the cultural sphere of the historical town in which he was born which absorbed his energy and engaged his mind; on the other was the open countryside to wander in and explore. A bank employee all his working life, both nature and culture of his home region fired Shenoy’s imagination and kindled his desire to imbue his community with the arts</p>
            <img  src="https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/photo/52405979.cms" height="160"  alt=" Vijayanath Shenoy">
            <p>It was when Shenoy turned to architecture and heritage conservation that his visual aesthetics evolved and concretised. He salvaged pieces of dismembered homes and used them to build his own home, Hasta Shilpa Heritage House, in 1990. It became a physical demonstration of how old things could still be used in aesthetic ways which were also harmonious with the local climate and environment. He soon became a champion for the conservation of built-heritage when he witnessed the thoughtless demolishing of the graceful, centuries-old homes in his region. When possible, he restored these to their former glory in their original locales; otherwise he trans-located them, piece by piece, to be reconstructed in Manipal.</p>
            <p>Thus was born Hasta Shilpa Heritage Village Museum in 1997 – an open-air museum realised in Manipal. It has several traditional houses and shrines and also many galleries of art, crafts, textiles, utensils, tools, furniture and toys. Shenoy also documented many of the lost classical and folk traditions for future generations. It was his hope that these age-old, classical buildings of the vernacular style would inspire the imagination of young people, just as they had fired his own.</p>

        <h3>HARIHARA MANDIR - 1216 </h3>         
            <p>The restored structure of Harihara Mandir is an architectural gem that stands out in the centre of a space, where several lanes and by lanes culminate as seen typically in villages. Its origin dates back to a hoary past about 800 years back, when it was supposedly built as a shrine for Veerabhadra by an extreme Shaivites sect called Kapalikas. Subsequently during the medieval age a Harihara statue was installed for reasons unknown. The passage of time further destroyed the structure, eventually collapsing into a heap covered by a mound of earth. Good sense prevailed in the minds of those villagers who chose to salvage only the dilapidated wooden components of the roof and windows as firewood, leaving behind the pillars and ceiling components since it had carvings of gods, fearing retribution.

Till then trade was carried out on waterways with a variety of agricultural produce like rice, spices, salt etc. being collected from inland villages and transported by boats through river ways to these coastal trading houses. It was then shipped through the sea route by large wooden sail ships to various port towns along the western coast of India and also the middleeast. The ‘Hungaracutta Bansaale Mane’ is a rare specimen that exemplifies trading activities which flourished three centuries back. Business transactions with customers was conducted in the front two levels, display and storage of the merchandise was located on left and right side of the courtyard, while the trader took up his residence across the courtyard at the rear. A first floor hall above the residence housed visiting traders from distant lands.
